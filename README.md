- ### CPU (Central Processing Unit) ðŸ“–
  1. The CPU is the primary component responsible for executing instructions and performing calculations in a computer.
  1. It fetches instructions from the computer's memory, decodes them, and then executes them.
  1. The CPU consists of multiple cores, each capable of executing instructions independently, which enables multitasking.
  1. It performs various operations, such as arithmetic calculations, logical comparisons, and data movement.
- ### RAM (Random Access Memory) ðŸ“–
  1. RAM is a type of volatile memory that provides temporary storage for data that the CPU needs to access quickly.
  1. It holds the data and instructions that the CPU is actively using, including the operating system, running programs, and data required for their execution.
  1. When you open a program or file, its data is loaded from the hard disk into RAM, allowing the CPU to access it faster.
  1. RAM has very fast read and write speeds, enabling quick data access for the CPU.
  1. The amount of RAM determines how many programs and how much data can be stored and accessed simultaneously.
- ### Hard DiskðŸ“–
  1. The hard disk (HDD or SSD) is a non-volatile storage device used for long-term data storage.
  1. It stores the operating system, software applications, files, and other data even when the computer is turned off.
  1. When you save a file, it is stored on the hard disk for future use.
  1. The hard disk has much larger storage capacity compared to RAM but slower data access times.
  1. Data on the hard disk is stored magnetically (HDD) or electronically (SSD) on spinning platters or flash memory chips, respectively.
  1. When data is needed from the hard disk, it is loaded into RAM for faster access by the CPU.
+ #### The interaction between these components can be summarized as followsðŸ“‘
  1. The CPU fetches instructions and data from RAM, where the operating system, software, and currently running programs are stored.
  1. It performs computations and manipulations on the data using its processing power.
  1. The CPU may need to access additional data or instructions that are not currently in RAM.
  1. In such cases, the required data is fetched from the hard disk and loaded into RAM so that the CPU can access it quickly.
  1. Once the CPU has finished processing the data, the results may be stored back in RAM or written back to the hard disk for long-term storage.
  1. This continuous interaction between the CPU, RAM, and hard disk allows the computer to execute programs, store and retrieve data efficiently, and provide a seamless user experience.

The relationship between these components can be understood as follows: The CPU retrieves instructions and data from the RAM and performs computations on them. The RAM acts as a bridge between the CPU and the hard disk, providing fast access to frequently used data and instructions. The hard disk stores data persistently, even when the computer is turned off, and it serves as a long-term storage solution for the operating system, software, and user files.
